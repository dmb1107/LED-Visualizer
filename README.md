# LED-Visualizer   
## Overview
* This is an IoT device that controls an LED strip using the [Blynk](https://blynk.io) mobile application.
* This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller hooked up with a WS2812B LED strip.
* Microphone input is taken from an Adafruit Max4466 Electret Microphone Amplifier.

## To Do
* Improve audio visualization using the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)
* Add more audio visualization modes
* Add more wave modes
